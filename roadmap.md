##### Roadmap:

- Add relevant tweets with a certain retweet, like, favorite... whatever 
count to be called out at a threshold. This could be done on a regular basis with 
an escalation workflow. Like "Newsworthy Event" + 4,000 retweets => send 
email/do something.
- Add livestream for specific tweet types. Maybe add in an email of top 10 hits 
per day or something.
- Add filter support for things that I'd want to see, something like "mentions me" 
or "damages my company's brand"
- Add user PICTURE to returned results... not sure if I want to do this yet.
- Add additional programmatic support for searching for other relevant tweet_data 
components, or at least documentation on how to do it.

##### Functions:

- Capture tweets of specific user
- Capture ALL DATA from a tweet
- Live-stream tweets from a specific user or with a specific word/phrase
- Interact with tweets (like, favorite, retweet) based on criteria
- Delete tweets as self based on criteria, (say for instance, cleaning up 
tweets with cursing)
- Support for posting tweets with content (attachments, links, hashtags, etc.)
