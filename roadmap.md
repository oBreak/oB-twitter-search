##### Roadmap:

- Add livestream for specific tweet types. Maybe add in an email of top 10 hits per day or something.
- Add filter support for things that I'd want to see, something like "mentions me" or "damages my company's brand"
- Add username to returned results
- Add userID to returned results
- Add user PICTURE to returned results... not sure if I want to do this yet.
- Add additional programmatic support for searching for other relevant tweet_data 
components, or at least documentation on how to do it.
