##### Roadmap:

- Add relevant tweets with a certain retweet, like, favorite... whatever 
count to be called out at a threshold. This could be done on a regular basis with 
an escalation workflow. Like "Newsworthy Event" + 4,000 retweets => send 
email/do something.
- Add livestream for specific tweet types. Maybe add in an email of top 10 hits per day or something.
- Add filter support for things that I'd want to see, something like "mentions me" or "damages my company's brand"
- Add user PICTURE to returned results... not sure if I want to do this yet.
- Add additional programmatic support for searching for other relevant tweet_data 
components, or at least documentation on how to do it.

##### Completed:

- Add userID to returned results
- Add username to returned results
